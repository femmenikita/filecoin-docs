# Community

### Community Overview

The Filecoin Community exists to govern the network, propose changes and improvements, and ensure that the values that underly the network are upheld. The Community’s goal is to make the Filecoin network efficient, robust, and usable. In order to ensure that the Community is aligned about the best way to move the mission of Filecoin forward, the Community needs to be aligned around the mission of the network and the values that the participants hold. 

There are key differences between mission and values. The mission of Filecoin is the high-level purpose and principals of the project. The values are the motivations and assumptions that help align the community around the mission. The Code of Conduct exists to ensure that we are all operating in a safe and friendly environment as we work toward the mission. 

### Mission

The Mission of Filecoin is to create a decentralized, efficient, and robust foundation for humanity’s information. This can be broken down further:

- Decentralized
    - The network is not dependent on any one party, e.g., not dependent on a company, foundation, or other organization to continue operating.
    - No centralized parties can control, stop, or censor the network, its operation, or its participants.
    - Users and providers are not controlled or governed by powerful intermediaries (unlike markets like Uber or Airbnb).
    - Activity is trustable (web3) through the public verifiability of operations and rational incentives.
    - Refers to the decentralization movement of 2015+, including IPFS, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and more.
    - Third parties cannot prevent willing participants from exchanging data and/or payments for it.
    - Filecoin uses cryptography, end-to-end encryption at rest, and incentives to secure information and network operation.
- Efficient
    - Make digital storage (spacetime) a proper commodity with real markets
    - Decouple digital storage from cloud computing moat feature sets -- turn storage market into a real market where any provider can sell their storage.
    - Enable humanity to create an efficient digital storage market, with small margins and as close as we can get to physical limitations.
    - Ensure efficient usage of digital storage resources -- reduce digital space waste (unused storage supply while prices are high enough to warrant using it).
    - Drive more and more efficient usage of storage media.
    - Enable fast (sub-second) buying and selling of spacetime.
    - Enable programs to buy and sell spacetime (without having to be humans or have an associated bank account) -- i.e., a cryptocurrency wallet and code should be enough to buy storage.
    - Clients can trust Filecoin will serve data quickly and efficiently back to them.
    - Filecoin will not waste user resources (storage, bandwidth, computation, time) unnecessarily.
- Robust
    - Filecoin has five 9s of uptime or more.
    - Clients can trust Filecoin to keep their data safe.
    - Clients can trust Filecoin to serve their data in a variety of extreme circumstances (in the distant future).
    - Clients can trust Filecoin to replicate storage and to self-repair lost replicas over time.
    - Clients can use Filecoin to store critical application data and trust it to work whenever they need that data back.
    - The network is robust to attack by all sorts of powerful parties, including state-level actors.
    - The network is robust to changing market dynamics and powerful counter incentives -- meaning, it is rational to continue operating the network.
    - The network is robust to network censorship attacks (given there exist willing storage providers).
    - The network is robust to specific file censorship attacks (given there exist willing storage providers).
    - The network is robust to catastrophic attacks (i.e., nuclear war, long-running internet partitions, etc.).

### Code of Conduct

The best way to make the vision of Filecoin become a reality is through a friendly, safe, and accepting community. Harassment, intimidation, and other behaviors that negatively impact the Filecoin Community will not be tolerated. 

All members of the community are expect to abide by the Code of Conduct at all time in all Filecoin community venues, online and in person, and in one-on-one communications about Filecoin. The Code of Conduct covers the usage of all Filecoin public infrasctructure, Filecoin websites, Filecoin related events, and services offered by or on behalf of Filecoin. We expect people to follow this Code of Conduct in Filecoin Open Source project communities, public GitHub repositories, IRC channels, social media, mailing lists, and public events. 

- Friendly Harassment-Free Space

     We ask that you please respect that people have differences of opinion regarding technical choices, and that every design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a single right answer. A difference of technology preferences is not a license to be rude.
    Any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting, or other attention-stealing behavior is not welcome, and will not be tolerated.
    Harassing other users is never tolerated, whether via public or private media.
    Avoid using offensive or harassing nicknames, or other identifiers that might detract from a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all.
     Harassment includes, but is not limited to: harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments related to gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, age, physical appearance, body size, race, or similar personal characteristics; inappropriate use of nudity, sexual images, and/or sexually explicit language in public spaces; threats of physical or non- physical harm; deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention.
