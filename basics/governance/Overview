### What is Filecoin?

Filecoin is a **blockchain**-based **decentralized storage network** designed to store humanity’s most important information. But what does this actually mean in the real world? 

Current cloud storage networks offer relatively limited services and are not always widely available. For the most part, these services are owned by just a few major providers who get to dictate the prices, areas of coverage, and who gets to use their service. Filecoin proposes a new storage model with economic incentives, with local storage around the globe that is owned and operated by the users of the network itself. This **hyper-local** and **peer-to-peer** model means more efficient access to data, freedom from **centralized storage** providers, and the ability to take part in the **governance** of the network in order to guide the direction of Filecoin. 

### **Who is part of the Filecoin Network?**
The Filecoin network is made up of several key players:
-**Storage Providers (SPs)**
-**Clients**
**-Ecosystem Partners**
**-Tokenholders**
**-Developers**
**-Filecoin Foundation**
**-Founding Engineers/Core Devs**

These groups and individuals are all part of the Filecoin **Community,** and help shape the future of the network. 

### How does the Filecoin network function?

Filecoin aims to democratize the way data is stored and shared, lower costs for storage, and provide economic incentives for those who participate in the network. 

What’s in it for **Storage Providers**? They get the opportunity to make storage accessible and usable for the storage of important data. Storage providers make it possible to create a transparent and equitable storage market. There is also a monetary incentive for Storage Providers in the form of FIL, the network’s native **cryptocurrency**. There are two main sources of revenue for SPs: providing storage and retrieval services, and by securing the Filecoin network. 

### What’s in it for **Clients**? 
They can rest easy knowing their data is securely stored, free from corporate control, resistant to censorship, and available across the globe. The prices to store data on the Filecoin network are competitive compared to traditional cloud storage, and network is highly flexible and reliable as it is verified regularly with both **proof-of-spacetime** and **proof-of-replication**. 

### What’s in it for the **Community**? 
The Filecoin Community guides the direction of the network, participating in the governance and overseeing the day-to-day operations of the network itself. Much of the governing of Filecoin is done through **Filecoin Improvement Proposals** (FIPs). Community members can submit FIPs to propose new features, changes to processes, or changes to the environment. They can also vote on FIPs, document their opinions, and build consensus within the community. Community members are also active in the Filecoin Slack, where they can discuss the current state and future of the Filecoin Network, meet like-minded individuals and organizations working to democratize data storage, and connect with projects happening across the network. Filecoin Foundation also hosts a variety of virtual and in-person events that the community can participate in across the globe, which offer opportunities for connection, learning, and building the future of data storage. 

### How is Filecoin governed?

Governance is a blanket term that means, simply, the process of overseeing the control and direction of something. The importance of governance is that it helps define who has power and accountability,  who gets to make decisions, and how the process of decision making happens. 

Filecoin operates on a decentralized model, which means that the people participating in the governance process have the opportunity to impact the network and set the direction it takes. Participation in a decentralized governance system means that individual people, organizations, and projects partners from around the world can all come to the table together to have their voices heard and find consensus about what is best for the network and how to help it achieve its mission. It is a very real model of ownership, personal investment, and responsibility that allows the community to work together in a clear and process-driven way.

Filecoin is governed through the FIP process, which lets anyone in the community author a recommendation for changes or improvements to the network. Currently, for a FIP to pass, soft consensus is required from the community. You can learn more about the FIP process [here]. 

The Community Guild also plays a critical role in the governance process, and is especially important for high-risk and complex FIPs. The Guild is made up of one representative from each of the following groups:
-Storage Providers
-Clients
-Ecosystem Parterns
-Tokenholders
-Developers
-Filecoin Foundation
-Founding Engineers/Core Devs

Each representative has one vote that is meant to represent the interests of the community they represent in the Guild. This serves to provide institutional representation, an expert consensus body, and a veto check on community voting. This is a critical governing body for complicated FIPs where consensus might be difficult or various parts of the community might be split on the best route forward. 

The Filecoin community is highly active, involved in the process, and dedicated to the mission of the network.
